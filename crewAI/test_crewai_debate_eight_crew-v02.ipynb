      "\n",
      "Counter Arguments:\n",
      "1. It is important to recognize that progress in women empowerment is not solely determined by policies and legislation, but also by societal attitudes and cultural norms that may differ between western and Asian countries.\n",
      "2. While western countries may have implemented progressive policies, they still face challenges in achieving true gender equality and empowering all women, especially those from marginalized communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary:\n",
      "In conclusion, the debate on women empowerment in western countries versus Asian countries is complex and multifaceted. While western countries have made strides in promoting gender equality, they still have room for improvement. Similarly, Asian countries are making progress in addressing gender disparities, but cultural barriers and societal expectations continue to pose challenges. It is crucial for both regions to work towards a more inclusive and equal society for all women, regardless of their geographical location.\n",
